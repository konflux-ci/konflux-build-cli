This file provides guidance on the Konflux Build CLI project.
It's a set of CLI commands from which Konflux Build Pipeline is created.

The commands should be able to run:
 - locally
 - in a local container
 - in a Kubernetus pod or Tekton task

## High-Level Project Structure

- `cmd` Cobra headers for commands, no logic.
- `pkg/commands` business logic of each command.
- `pkg/cliwrappers` wrappers over external CLI tools used.
- `pkg/common` utilities shared between all commands.
- `pkg/config` utility to access global Konflux configuration.
- `docs` documentation.
- `docs/design` design / ADRs.
- `integration_tests` all integration tests.
- `integration_tests/framework` framework to run integration tests.

## Verification

Run these commands before submitting changes:
- `make unit-test` — run all unit tests
- `make lint` — run golangci-lint (installs automatically)
- `make fmt` — format code

## Integration Test Conventions

When asserting on build stderr in `image build` integration tests, call
`filterBuildahSteps` first to strip buildah's echoed RUN instructions.

## Renovate / MintMaker Configuration

This repo uses MintMaker for dependency management. MintMaker provides a
platform-level Renovate config that sets `gomod.packageRules`. In Renovate's
config hierarchy, manager-level `packageRules` take precedence over global
`packageRules`. When adding Go-module-specific rules, place them under
`gomod.packageRules` in `renovate.json`, not in the top-level `packageRules`
array.

When modifying `renovate.json`, check the MintMaker config to understand which
manager-level `packageRules` are set upstream.

MintMaker's config:
